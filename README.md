### WELCOME!!! ðŸ‘‹

As a seasoned professional, I'm eager to transition my career to the world of a web developer. 
In doing so, Iâ€™d leverage my previous skills and experiences in effective communication, collaboration, 
problem-solving, adaptability, time management, and professionalism to contribute to a developer role. 
My enrollment in web development courses at DCI demonstrates my commitment to this career change and skill enhancement.
